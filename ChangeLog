	* implemented thread-save sensitivity - BREAKING SENSE INTERFACES!:
	** moved sensitivity structures from odeModel_t to new odeSense_t
	** separated compilation of odeModel and odeSense functions, therefore 
	** removed TCC (doesn't support multiple code states) online compilation
	* added CV_NORMAL_TSTOP mode for CVODES forward solver
	** added CvodeSettings_setTStop to allow saver dynamic value update
	** automatic usage of TSTOP for event and discontinuous models

2007-08-22 Christoph Flamm <xtof@tbi.univie.ac.at>
	* added gcc compilation on-the-fly capability. This solves the
	32/64 bit architecture problems we had with TCC.

2007-06-20 James Lu and Stefan Mueller 
	* implemented adjoint solver for discrete observation data
	* etc. ??

2007-06-12 Christoph Flamm <xtof@tbi.univie.ac.at>
	* updated library sources to work with sundials suit v2.3.0

2007-05-11 Rainer Machne <raim@tbi.univie.ac.at>
	* added Tiny C Compiler (TCC) compilation on-the-fly
	capability (problems: TCC only works for 32 bit architecture).

2008-03-10 Rainer Machne <raim@tbi.univie.ac.at>
	* repaired varySettings and batch integration for design points
	as initially intended by Witold Eryk Wolski
